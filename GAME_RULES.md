# 🎰 Zynga Pro Slot: Game Manual & Rules

## 1. Introduction
**Zynga Pro Slot** is a high-volatility 5-reel video slot machine. It captures the thrill of classic casino gaming with modern mechanics. The game features a **5x3 grid** (5 vertical reels, 3 horizontal rows) and **20 fixed paylines**.

**Objective:** Spin the reels to line up matching symbols on valid paylines. The more matches you get, the bigger the payout.

## 2. The Symbols (The Cast)

The game features a hierarchy of symbols, each with different values and behaviors.

### ✨ Special Symbols

| Symbol | Name | Function |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🃏 | **WILD** (Joker) | **The Substitute.** It stands in for *any* other symbol (except Scatter) to help you complete a winning line. <br> *Example:* `A - WILD - A` counts as `A - A - A`. |
| 💎 | **SCATTER** (Gem) | **The Bonus Trigger.** These don't need to be on a line! If you see 3 or more of these *anywhere* on the screen, you win. |

### 🏆 Paying Symbols

These symbols pay when they appear consecutively from the **leftmost reel** to the right.

*   **A (Ace)**: The highest paying regular symbol. Red and bold.
*   **K (King)**: High value. Blue.
*   **Q (Queen)**: Medium value.
*   **J (Jack)**: Lower value.
*   **10**: The most common symbol.

### ⬛ Blanks
To increase the excitement and volatility, this game features **Blanks** (empty spaces). If a Blank lands on a payline, it breaks the chain. You cannot win with Blanks.

## 3. How to Win (Paylines)

A "Payline" is a specific pattern that lines cross the screen. You only win if symbols line up exactly on these paths.

*   **Rule 1: Left-to-Right**: All wins must start from Reel 1 (the far left). A combo like `Blank - A - A - A - A` pays nothing because it didn't start at the beginning.
*   **Rule 2: Consecutive**: Symbols must be next to each other on the line. `A - A - Blank - A` breaks the chain at 2 matches.
*   **Rule 3: 20 Lines**: There are 20 different patterns active on every spin.
    *   *Straight Lines*: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row.
    *   *V-Shapes*: Top-Left to Bottom-Middle to Top-Right.
    *   *Zig-Zags*: Various complex paths across the grid.

## 8. Common Myths & Mechanics

### "Is this a Card Game?"
**No.** While we use card symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10), this is **not** Poker or Blackjack.
*   **Card Games**: Use a deck of 52 cards. If you hold an Ace, there are only 3 Aces left in the deck.
*   **Slots**: Use **Reels** (spinning wheels). Each reel is independent and contains many copies of the same symbol. It is perfectly possible (and lucky!) to see **15 Aces** on the screen at the same time.

### "Is it due for a win?"
**No.** Every spin is calculated by a Random Number Generator (RNG) the instant you click the button. The machine has no memory. If you just hit a Jackpot, your odds of hitting another Jackpot on the very next spin are exactly the same.
